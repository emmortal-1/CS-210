            <li>Nice font with several of the buttons leading to there acutal stuff.</li>

        <h3>Additional Comments</h3>
        <p>
            The website is very well structured and easy to navigate. The light mode colors are very nice and relaxing. 
            The font is also very nice and easy to read. The buttons are very nice and lead to their actual stuff. 
            I noticed that there wasn't a way to get back from the "About" (Cat) page to the home page.
            I obviously, did like the Cat page the best. Even if I don't have a cat myself I used to so it's always good to see a cute cat every now and then.
            My only question would be why theres not any videos on your Youtube channel, you gotta give me some content to watch if your gonna link it ðŸ™„.
