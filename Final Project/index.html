        <div class="webpage-review">
            <h3>Webpage 1</h3>
            <p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://daverupert.com/">https://daverupert.com/</a></p>
            <p><strong>What I liked:</strong> The color choices add a nice pop but are also clean at the same time.
            The personal touches of the book he's read and like along with his many projects and articles adds to his long list of credentials.</p>
            <p><strong>What I disliked:</strong> While the sheer amount of content he's put on his websites is impressive the process of navigating through them, isnt as clean as the rest if his site
            Having to scroll for a longer then wanted time to see certain ariticles can be quite annoying.</p>
            <p><strong>Unique Idea:</strong> I would include an interactive timeline of my career achievements to make my page stand out.
            Definitly changing how we can view his articles and stories would make the site feel compelete to me.</p>

            <h3>Webpage 2</h3>
            <p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://jamie-wong.com/">https://jamie-wong.com/</a></p>
            <p><strong>What I liked:</strong> Super minimalistic design that has a both professional and fun asthetic to it.
            The short intro gets straight to the point with what he does and the simple buttons to take you to websites of interest regarding him.</p>
            <p><strong>What I disliked:</strong> Similar to the previous site he has a long list of articles he's writting but again it requires you to scroll for a long period of time to see all of them which can be a hasle.</p>
            <p><strong>Unique Idea:</strong> It would be nice to see a couple buttons to other parts of this webpage of some more personal stuff like his projects.
            As well of course as changing the way we view his articles that isn't scrolling.</p>

            <h3>Webpage 3</h3>
            <p><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/">https://www.taniarascia.com/</a></p>
            <p><strong>What I liked:</strong> This site is my personal favorite out of te three, her clean dark mode asthetic with some hints of bright color is very captivating.
            Similar to the other two sites there features a decent bit of scrolling, but in this site it doesn't feel as though I'm scrolling very far.
            Her use of sections that clearly state and show what this portion of the site is about is very nice. As well as the fact she has many things to share on her website.
            The customization with what acsent colors you would like to see throught the website is super cool and unique.</p>
            <p><strong>What I disliked:</strong> Personally I don't think I'd change anything about this site.</p>
            <p><strong>Unique Idea:</strong> She honestly includes everything I can think I'd want in my website, it's going to be hard to not just steal her whole design for my own website project.</p>
